#+TITLE: Powerful things with simple configs

A set of small standalone configs that unlock awesome powers.

* Small configs that do big things

To try out the awesome power of simple configs, any of the files of this repo
can be used as a standalone =~/.emacs.d/init.el=.

To try them out quick, add the following to your own =~/.emacs.d/init.el= and
uncomment the parts that you want to use.

#+begin_src 
(setq emacs-configs-repo "~/Documents/GitHub/emacs-configs")

;; (load-file (concat emacs-config-repo "/babel-config.el")
;; (load-file (concat emacs-config-repo "/org-export-config.el")
;; (load-file (concat emacs-config-repo "/basic-configs.el")
;; (load-file (concat emacs-config-repo "/helpers.el")
;; (load-file (concat emacs-config-repo "/evil-config.el")
#+end_src

*Note* : To make each file usable standalone, I have repeated code accross some
 files.  This causes warnings.  If you use these configs in your own, be mindful
 not to copy-paste duplicated code.

Duplicated code is mostly the adding to
 =package-archives= and installing =use-package=, and there is also the setting
 of =org-agenda-files= that is repeated.
